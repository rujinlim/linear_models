```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) |> 
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) |> 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") |> 
  select(price, stars, borough, neighborhood, room_type)
```

Let's fit a model

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```
